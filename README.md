# Pre-Processing of Data from the PhenoSys Touchscreen chamber üêÅ

### Overview

__PhenoSys Touchscreen Chamber__

The [Touchscreen Chambers](https://www.phenosys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PhenoSys_Touchscreen_-Paradigms_1911.pdf) from [PhenoSys](https://www.phenosys.com/) contain a pellet dispenser and images/touch screens. 
These screens light up and need to be pressed in the correct order to receive a pellet as a reward. 
This apparatus has enabled the measurement of learning over time in novel models of disease in rodents.

__Purpose__

The raw CSV output from the Touchscreen Chambers is large (~5 MB) and is highly time-consuming to process and obtain statistics of interest. This repository:
* Analyses the data from the paradigms GTPT2-5, 2VDLR, 5CSRTT and TUNL.
* Creates a colour-coded list of all key events in order of time.
* For each animal, these codes creates statistics about:
  * Individual sessions
  * Indvidual sessions split by stimulus durations and inter-trial intervals
  * Time bins over time
  * Snips videos for each experiment into many session clips
